1.User controllers issues

2.Video controllers issues

    2.getting internal server in update video controller
    3.getting error in delete video controller
    4.i need to do like, comment and view operation just with published video and i just need to fetch only published videos 

    (AT ALL IN ISSUE 1 AND ISSUE 2 , I AM JUST GETTING CLOUDINARY ERROR SO I JUST NEED TO RESOLVE THAT)


3.Comment controller issues(THIS WILL BE SOLVED WHILE MAKING FRONTEND)
    1.this controller is fully working without errors but i realized that i should also add a comment section in the tweet(this is optional)


4.Tweet controller issues(SOLVED)

    1.i have only added get user tweets controller but i have to add get all tweets to get tweets for the tweet page.
   

5.Like controller issues(SOLVED)
    1.No issues found but i realized i am not aggregating likes with tweet and comments anywhere in the app but that is a must so i have to do that.


6.Subscription controller issues(SOLVED)
    1.this controller is fully working.


7.Views controller issues(SOLVED)
    1.this controller is fully working for now but i also have to integrate views with post(tweet).


8.Dashboard controller issues(SOLVED)
    1.when there are no documents of total likes found then i need to send 0 as the total likes count doesnt count set number of likes to 0 if there are no documents matched.


9.Playlist controller issues(THIS WILL BE SOLVED WHILE MAKING FRONTEND)
    1.in add video we should just send the playlist with number of videos , we shouldn't send the videos id array or i think that i should send the aggregated videos (i will choose one of these two solutions according to how i design this feature in the frontend)


10.Adding a handlePaginationFunction which can check for errors in the pagination queries
    routes where pagination are used: 
        1.get all videos
        2.get all video comments
        3.get user tweets
        4.get watch history
        5.get liked videos
        6.get subscribed channels 
        7.get channel subscribers
        8.get channel videos(dashboard controller)
        9.get playlists
        10.get playlist videos by id
        11.get all tweets(after adding this controller to tweet controllers)
        

11. I need to rewrite the logic of watch history

THIS IS THE END OF TESTING THE CONTROLLERS MANUALLY. NOW IN 2 OR 3 DAYS I WILL SOLVE THESE ISSUES
